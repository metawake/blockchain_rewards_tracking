# Rewards Dashboard Playground

This project serves as a playground to investigate how rewards data can be visualized on different dashboards. It generates fake rewards data and provides visualization methods using Python libraries.

## Overview

The project explores various visualization techniques for displaying rewards data obtained from different networks. It utilizes Python's Faker library to generate synthetic rewards data and provides functions to visualize this data using popular plotting libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Faker Library

[Faker](https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/) is a Python library that generates fake data for a variety of use cases. It provides a convenient way to create realistic-looking data for testing, prototyping, and simulation purposes. In this project, Faker is used to generate synthetic rewards data mimicking the structure of real-world rewards data.

## Data Format

The rewards data generated by this project follows a specific format:

```python
{
    'network1': {
        'user1': [{'date': date1, 'reward': reward1}, {'date': date2, 'reward': reward2}, ...],
        'user2': [{'date': date1, 'reward': reward1}, {'date': date2, 'reward': reward2}, ...],
        ...
    },
    'network2': {
        'user1': [{'date': date1, 'reward': reward1}, {'date': date2, 'reward': reward2}, ...],
        'user2': [{'date': date1, 'reward': reward1}, {'date': date2, 'reward': reward2}, ...],
        ...
    },
    ...
}
```


Each network contains a dictionary where each key represents a user ID and its value is a list of dictionaries, each containing a date and the corresponding reward amount.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the provided Python scripts to generate fake rewards data and visualize it using the available functions.

## Visualization Methods

- **Weekly Rewards Bar Chart:** Displays the weekly rewards for each network, with a separate set of columns for each network and a sum column next to them.
- **Monthly Rewards Pie Chart:** Shows the distribution of total rewards among different networks for each month in a pie chart format.

Feel free to explore and experiment with different visualization techniques and adapt the code according to your requirements.
